[Mailcoach](https://mailcoach.app) is a self-hosted email marketing platform that integrates with services like Amazon SES, Mailgun, Postmark or Sendgrid to send out bulk mailings and drip campaigns affordably. It can also keep track of all transactional mails sent out by your Laravel app.

Stand-alone, or integrated in a Laravel project, it's the perfect email list service for bloggers, artisans and entrepreneurs.
