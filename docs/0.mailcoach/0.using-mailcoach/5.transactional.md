## Exploring the UI

### Logging and tracking transactional mails

When installed in a Laravel application, Mailcoach can log and display any sent mail in the UI.  It can optionally track opens and clicks of those transactional mails.

On the "Content" screen you can see the content of a mail.

If you've enabled tracking, then the opens and clicks of a mail can be seen on the "Performance" screen.

A transactional mail can be resent on the "Resend" screen.

### Defining transactional mail templates

On the "Templates" screen you can define and edit templates containing the style and content of transactional mails.

On the "Content" screen you can define the content of a transactional mail. You can [define placeholders](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/transactional-mails/using-templates#using-replacers) that users of the template can use.

On the "Settings" screen of the template you can select the [format of the template](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/transactional-mails/using-templates#using-template-types), and specify how it should be tracked.
