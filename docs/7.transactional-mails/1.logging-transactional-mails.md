title: Logging transactional mails
---

Mailcoach can store transactional mails, record any opens and clicks, and even resend them.

## Getting started

To work with transactional mails in Mailcoach, you should use
 `Spatie\Mailcoach\Domain\TransactionalMail\Mails\Concerns\StoresMail` trait on your Mailable class.

## Storing mails

In the 
 `content` function of your mailable, you should call the `store` method provided by the trait.

```php
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Envelope;
use Spatie\Mailcoach\Domain\TransactionalMail\Mails\Concerns\StoresMail;

class YourMailable extends Mailable
{
    use StoresMail;

    public function envelope(): Envelope
    {
        return new Envelope(
            subject: 'Your order has been shipped!'
        );
    }
    
    public function content(): Content
    {
        $this->store();
    
        return new Content(
            markdown: 'mails.orderShipped'
        );
    }
}
```

If you're using `build` in your mailable, you can also the `store` method provided by the trait like this.


```php
class YourMailable extends Mailable
{
    use StoresMail;

    public function build()
    {
        $this
            ->store()
            ->view('mails.your-mailable')
    }
}
```

Whenever this mailable is sent, Mailcoach will store and display it in the UI.

## Tracking opens and clicks

When enabled with your email provider, transactional mails will track opens & clicks as well.

Tracking opens and/or clicks requires Mailcoach to store the mail, so you have to call `store` separately.

```php
class YourMailable extends Mailable
{
    public function content(): Content
    {
        $this->store();
    
        return new Content(
            markdown: 'mails.orderShipped'
        );
    }
}
```


## Resending stored mails

You can resend stored transactional mails via the UI or by calling `resend` on the `Spatie\Mailcoach\Domain\TransactionalMail\Models\TransactionalMail` model

```php
TransactionalMail::find($id)->resend();
```
