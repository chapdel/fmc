Before installing Mailcoach, make sure you have [a valid license](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/installation/getting-a-license).

There are two ways to install Mailcoach on traditional hosting (for Vapor, head to [the dedicated instructions](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/installation-on-vapor/):

1. If you already have a Laravel 8 application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it. Doing so, you can integrate Mailcoach in your application in many interesting ways. If you know Laravel, then this is the recommended route. Head over to the [package installation instructions](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/installation/in-an-existing-laravel-app) to continue.

2. If you have experience with Laravel and PHP, but don't want to install Mailcoach in an existing application, you can use our standalone app. This standalone app is a regular Laravel app, where Mailcoach has been preinstalled with. It also comes with basic user management. You can [use composer to create this standalone app](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/installation/as-a-standalone-app).
