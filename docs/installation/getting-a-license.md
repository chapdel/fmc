In order to use Mailcoach, you must buy a license. You can buy a license at [our store](https://spatie.be/products/mailcoach).

Single domain licenses are valid for the installation of Mailcoach on a single domain or subdomain. In case you bought the unlimited domain license, there are no restrictions. A licence comes with one year of upgrades. If a license expires, you are still allowed to use Mailcoach, but you won't get any updates anymore.
