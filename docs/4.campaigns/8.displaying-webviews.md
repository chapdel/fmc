title: Displaying webviews
---

Whenever you send a campaign, a webview is also created. A webview is a hard to guess URL that people who didn't subscribe can visit to read the content of your campaign.

You can get to the URL of the webview of a campaign:

```php
$campaign->webViewUrl();
```

## Customizing the webview

You can customize the webview. To do this, you must publish all views:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Mailcoach\MailcoachServiceProvider" --tag="mailcoach-views"
```

After that, you can customize the `webview.blade.php` view in the `resources/views/vendor/mailcoach/campaign`directory.

## Hiding elements from the generated webview

You can hide elements from the generated webview by wrapping them in `<!-- webview:hide --> ... <!-- /webview:hide -->` tags.

For example:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<!-- webview:hide -->
		<span>Is this email not displaying correctly? <a href="{{ webviewUrl }}">View online version</a></span>
		<!-- /webview:hide -->

		<div>
			... The rest of your email content
		</div>
		
		<!-- webview:hide -->
		<a href="{{ unsubscribeUrl }}">Unsubscribe</a>
		<!-- /webview:hide -->
	</body>
</html>
```

This will hide the unsubscribe and webview links from the generated webview HTML, making your email only display its essentials.
