When creating an automation mail, you can either create a new one from scratch or duplicate an existing one to copy most of its settings:

### Settings

Most of the settings for creating a new automation mail are pretty self-explanatory:

The name of an automation mail is only used within your Mailcoach UI. Subscribers will not see this anywhere.

The value for the _Subject_ field is used as the subject for sent emails.

Finally, the tracking options allow you to track how many subscribers have opened your email and whether they clicked any of the links you included. You can see what the result of this tracking looks like in the [Automation mail statistics](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/using-the-ui/automations#automation-mail-statistics) section of the documentation.

### Content

This is the content of the email that will be sent to your subscribers. If you duplicated another campaign, this field will be the same as that automation mail's content.

You can -_and should_- use placeholders in your emails. We strongly suggest including at least the `::unsubscribeUrl::` in every email you send, for example at the bottom of the email. Not including this link may lead to your users complaining or emails being marked as spam.

While editing your email, you can see what it will look like for subscribers by clicking the _Preview_ button.

Since we are sending out mails in UTF-8, it's good practice including following charset definition in the `<head>` of your HTML as well. This way, special characters will also correctly show up in your preview.

```HTML
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
```

### Delivery

This page provides a final checklist that you should go over before sending an automation mail. It shows a summary of the mail's settings, the subject and any issues we found with your email's content.

You can also send a test email to yourself for a final review before sending it out to your subscribers' mailboxes.

## Mail statistics

The summary contains all the statistics for an automation mail that is being sent. These statistics will be updated regularly, so you can closely track the success of your mails.

This page shows a summary of the statistics for your automation mail. At a glance, you can see how many people opened your email and clicked any links you included, and also how many people unsubscribed from your mailing list as a result of this campaign and how often the emails bounced.

A bounce means that an email could not be delivered to a certain email address, this could happen for several reasons. You can better find out why in the [_Outbox_](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/using-the-ui/automations#outbox) tab.

### Opens and clicks

On the _Opens_ screen, you can see which subscribers have already opened your email, and when.

The _Clicks_ screen has information on which links were opened and how many times. The _Unique clicks_ column concerns how many unique users have clicked your link.

### Unsubscribes

You can also see how many people, regrettably, clicked the unsubscribe link in this campaign.

### Outbox

Here, you can see a collection of all the individual emails that were sent to your subscribers, and whether they encountered any issues upon arriving at their destination.
