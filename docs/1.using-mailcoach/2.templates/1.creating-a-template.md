title: Creating a template
---

To create a template, head over to your [templates screen](/templates) and click the "Create template" button.

Depending on which [editor](/settings/editor) you've configured as the template editor, you'll either see an HTML editor or a drag-and-drop (Unlayer) editor.

You can add "slots" to your template by entering the slot name between triple brackets, for example: `[[[content]]]`.

Once you create an email with this template, you'll get a field with your configured content editor for each slot.

<!-- @todo: Screenshot -->

You can also create templates without any slots, these will copy the full HTML contents to the email when used.
