Mailcoach is a powerhour

There are three ways of installing Mailcoach.

1. If you already have a Laravel 8 application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it. Doing so, you can integrate Mailcoach in your application in many interesting ways. If you know Laravel, then this is the recommand route. Head over to the [package installation instructions](/docs/v3/package/general/installation-and-setup) to continue.

2. If you have experience with Laravel and PHP, but don't want to install Mailcoach in an existing application, you can use our standalone app. This standadlone app is a regular Laravel app, where Mailcoach has been preinstalled with. It also comes with basic user management. You can [use composer to create this standalone app](https://mailcoach.app/docs/v3/app/installation/using-composer).

3. If you have no experience with Laravel or PHP, you can still use Mailcoach. [Our 1-click-installer]() can provision a new server at Digital Ocean, and install Mailcoach on it as a standalone application with basic user managment.
