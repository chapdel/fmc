title: In an existing Laravel app
---

If you have experience with Laravel and/or PHP, and have a Laravel 8 application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it.

The package is called `spatie/laravel-mailcoach` Installing Mailcoach as a package offers great ways of customizing Mailcoach. Anything that can be done via the Mailcoach UI, can also be done via code.

You can tightly integrate Mailcoach into your application logic. You can listen for the various events that Mailcoach fires when mails are opened, clicked, ... to execute custom logic. Mailcoach stores information in the database using regular Eloquent models, that can be used by your application code too.

## Getting a license

In order to install Mailcoach, you'll need to [get a license](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/general/getting-a-license) first.

## Installation via Composer

First, add the `satis.spatie.be` repository in your `composer.json`.

```php
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://satis.spatie.be"
    }
],
```

Next, you need to create a file called `auth.json` and place it either next to the `composer.json` file in your project, or in the composer home directory. You can determine the composer home directory on *nix machines by using this command.

```bash
composer config --list --global | grep home
```

This is the content you should put in `auth.json`:

```php
{
    "http-basic": {
        "satis.spatie.be": {
            "username": "<YOUR-SPATIE.BE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE>",
            "password": "<YOUR-LICENSE-KEY-HERE>"
        }
    }
}
```

If you are using [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com), you don't need to create the `auth.json` file manually. Instead, you can set the credentials on the Composer Package Authentication screen of your server. Fill out the fields with these values:

- Repository URL: `satis.spatie.be`
- Username: Fill this field with your spatie.be account email address
- Password: Fill this field with your Mailcoach license key

![screenshot](/images/docs/v6/forge.png)

To validate if Composer can read your `auth.json` you can run this command:

```bash
composer config --list --global | grep satis.spatie.be
````

If you did everything correctly, the above command should display your credentials. If that command doesn't display anything, verify that you created an auth.json as mentioned above.

With this configuration in place, you'll be able to install the package into your project using this command:

```bash
composer require "spatie/laravel-mailcoach:^5.0"
```

## Publish the config file

Optionally, You can publish the config file with this command.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Mailcoach\MailcoachServiceProvider" --tag="mailcoach-config"
```

Check out the default contents of the config file [here](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-mailcoach/blob/main/config/mailcoach.php)

## Configure an email sending service

Mailcoach can send out mail via various email sending services and can handle the feedback (opens, clicks, bounces, complaints) those services give.

Head over to the Laravel documentation to learn [how to set up a mailer](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/mail#configuration).

Mailcoach can use different mailers for sending confirmation & welcome mails and campaign mails. This way you can keep very good reputations with the mailer service you use for campaign mails, as the confirmation mails might bounce.

To use different mailers, fill in the name of configured mailers in the `campaigns.mailer` and `transactional.mailer` of the `mailcoach.php` config file.

To configure tracking open, clicks, bounces & complaints, follow the instruction on the dedicated docs page of each supported service.

- [Amazon SES](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/amazon-ses)
- [Mailgun](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/mailgun)
- [Sendgrid](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/sendgrid)
- [Postmark](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/postmark)

## Prepare the database

You need to publish and run the migration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Mailcoach\MailcoachServiceProvider" --tag="mailcoach-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

## Add the route macro

You must register the routes needed to handle subscription confirmations, open, and click tracking. We recommend that you don't put this in your routes file, but in the `boot` method of `RouteServiceProvider`

```php
Route::mailcoach('mailcoach');
```

## Schedule the commands

In the console kernel, you should schedule these commands.

Regarding the mailcoach:cleanup-processed-feedback command, be aware that email providers such as SES are a 'deliver at least once' service. Duplicate feedback delivery could be seen weeks after the event. Mailcoach prevents duplicates from SES by checking for old matching feedback. As such, cleaning up historical feedback webhooks could lead to duplicate feedbacks items being processed multiple times. The end result is inflated open and click metrics.

```php
// in app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // ...
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:send-automation-mails')->everyMinute()->withoutOverlapping()->runInBackground();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:send-scheduled-campaigns')->everyMinute()->withoutOverlapping()->runInBackground();

    $schedule->command('mailcoach:run-automation-triggers')->everyMinute()->runInBackground();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:run-automation-actions')->everyMinute()->runInBackground();

    $schedule->command('mailcoach:calculate-statistics')->everyMinute();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:calculate-automation-mail-statistics')->everyMinute();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:rescue-sending-campaigns')->hourly();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:send-campaign-summary-mail')->hourly();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:cleanup-processed-feedback')->hourly();
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:send-email-list-summary-mail')->mondays()->at('9:00');
    $schedule->command('mailcoach:delete-old-unconfirmed-subscribers')->daily();
}
```

## Publish the assets

You must publish the JavaScript and CSS assets using this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag mailcoach-assets --force
```

To ensure that these assets get republished each time Mailcoach is updated, we highly recommend you add the following command to the `post-update-cmd` of the `scripts` section of your `composer.json`.

```php
"scripts": {
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag mailcoach-assets --force"
    ]
}
```

## Take care of throttling

It's common for e-mail providers to limit the number of e-mails you can send within a given amount of time. You should look up the limits of the email sending provider that you will use, and specify the throttling limits in the `throttling` of the `mailcoach` config file.

## Install Horizon

This package handles various tasks in a queued way via [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon). If your application doesn't have Horizon installed yet, follow [their installation instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon#installation).

After Horizon is installed, don't forget to set `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in your `.env` file to `redis`.

`config/horizon.php` should have been created in your project. In this config file, you must add a block named `mailcoach-general` and `mailcoach-heavy` to both the `production` and `local` environment.

```php
'environments' => [
    'production' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'connection' => 'redis',
            'queue' => ['default'],
            'balance' => 'simple',
            'processes' => 10,
            'tries' => 2,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
        'mailcoach-general' => [
            'connection' => 'mailcoach-redis',
            'queue' => ['mailcoach', 'mailcoach-feedback', 'send-mail', 'send-automation-mail'],
            'balance' => 'auto',
            'processes' => 10,
            'tries' => 2,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
        'mailcoach-heavy' => [
            'connection' => 'mailcoach-redis',
            'queue' => ['send-campaign'],
            'balance' => 'auto',
            'processes' => 3,
            'tries' => 1,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
    ],

    'local' => [
        'supervisor-1' => [
            'connection' => 'redis',
            'queue' => ['default'],
            'balance' => 'simple',
            'processes' => 10,
            'tries' => 2,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
        'mailcoach-general' => [
            'connection' => 'mailcoach-redis',
            'queue' => ['mailcoach', 'mailcoach-feedback', 'send-mail', 'send-automation-mail'],
            'balance' => 'auto',
            'processes' => 10,
            'tries' => 2,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
        'mailcoach-heavy' => [
            'connection' => 'mailcoach-redis',
            'queue' => ['send-campaign'],
            'balance' => 'auto',
            'processes' => 3,
            'tries' => 1,
            'timeout' => 60 * 60,
        ],
    ],
],
```

In the `config/queue.php` file you must add the `mailcoach-redis` connection:

```php
'connections' => [

    // ...

    'mailcoach-redis' => [
        'driver' => 'redis',
        'connection' => 'default',
        'queue' => env('REDIS_QUEUE', 'default'),
        'retry_after' => 11 * 60,
        'block_for' => null,
    ],
```

## Add authorization to Mailcoach UI

`laravel-mailcoach` does not come with any user management, we assume that you already provide this in your own app. You can use a gate check to determine who can access Mailcoach.

You can determine which users of your application are allowed to view the mailcoach UI by defining a gate check called `viewMailcoach`.

Here's an example where we assume that administrators of your application have a `admin` attribute that is set to `true`. This gate definition will only allow administrators to use the Mailcoach UI.

```php
// in a service provider

public function boot()
{
   \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate::define('viewMailcoach', function ($user = null) {
       return optional($user)->admin;
   });
}
```

Mailcoach will redirect unauthorized users to the route specified in the `redirect_unauthorized_users_to_route` key of the Mailcoach config file. By default, the `login` route is used. If you don't have a `login` route in your application, set this setting to a route that does exist.

## Specifying a timezone

By default, all dates in Mailcoach are in UTC. If you want to use another timezone, you can change the `timezone` setting in the `config/app.php` config file.

## Choosing an editor

By default, Mailcoach uses a plain textarea field to edit campaigns and templates. If you'd like to use a feature rich editor, you can [use one of the add-on packages](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/choosing-an-editor/introduction).

## Visit the UI

After performing all these steps, you should be able to visit the Mailcoach UI at `/mailcoach`.

Before sending out a real campaign, we highly recommend creating a small email list with a couple of test email addresses and send a campaign to it. This way, you can verify that sending mails, and the open & click tracking are all working correctly.
