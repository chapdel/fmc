title: Getting a license
---

In order to use Mailcoach, you must buy a license from [our store](https://spatie.be/products/mailcoach) on spatie.be.

The **single domain license** is suitable if you plan to use Mailcoach for sending emails to your clients.
It is only valid on a single domain or subdomain.

The **unlimited domains license** is suitable if you're going to implement Mailcoach into your (SaaS) application that lets your customers send emails.

## Duration of a license
A license includes one year of upgrades. Even if your license expires, you can continue to use Mailcoach, but you won't receive any further updates.

## What happens when your license expires?

A few days before a license expires, we'll send you a reminder mail to renew your license.

Should you decide not to renew your license, you won't be able to use Composer anymore to install this package. You won't get any new features or bug fixes.

In this case, you can download a zip file containing the latest version that your license covered. Visit [your purchases page](https://spatie.be/profile/purchases) on spatie.be for access, which you can host in your private repository.
