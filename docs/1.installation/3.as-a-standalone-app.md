title: As a standalone app
---

If you don't know Laravel, but have basic PHP knowledge and know how to deploy to a server, you can follow these instructions.

You can create a new Laravel application with Mailcoach preinstalled into using Composer. This application will also have authorization screens (login, password reset) and user management.

## Getting a license

In order to install Mailcoach, you'll need to [get a license](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/general/getting-a-license) first.

### Creating the application

You can create the application with Mailcoach pre-installed using this command

```bash
composer create-project spatie/Mailcoach
```

During the execution of this command Composer will ask for a user and a password. The user is the email address 
of your spatie.be account. The password is the key of your [Mailcoach license](https://spatie.be/profile/purchases).

### Creating the database

Next, you must update the values of the `DB_*` entries in `.env` so they match your db. After that run `php artisan migrate` to create all tables.

### Creating the first user

After that you can create an initial user by executing `php artisan mailcoach:make-user`. You can use the created user to login at Mailcoach. New user can be made on the users screen in mailcoach.

### Configure the email sending service

Now that you are logged in you must configure the email sending service you'd like to use. Here are set up instructions for

- [Amazon SES](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/amazon-ses)
- [SendGrid](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/sendgrid)
- [Mailgun](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/mailgun)
- [Postmark](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/configuring-mail-providers/postmark)

### Running Horizon

This package handles various tasks in a queued way via [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/horizon). The `horizon.php` config is already preconfigured. You only need to [make sure that Horizon runs](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/horizon#running-horizon).

### Running The Scheduler

This package relies on the laravel scheduler, be sure to schedule the execution of `php artisan schedule:run` to run every minute.

### Making sure everything works

Before sending out a real campaign, we highly recommend creating a small email list with a couple of test email addresses and send a campaign to it. This way, you can verify that sending mails, and the open & click tracking are all working correctly.
