title: Throttling sends
---

Most email providers have a limit on how many emails you can send within a given amount of time. By default, five mails per second will be sent. You can add throttling config to your mailer:

```php
// config/mail.php
'mailers' => [
    'ses' => [
        'transport' => 'ses',
        
        // Throttling for 10 mails / second
        'timespan_in_seconds' => 1,
        'mails_per_timespan' => 10,
    ],
]
```
