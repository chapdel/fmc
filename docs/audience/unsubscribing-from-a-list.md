title: Unsubscribing from a list

You can add an unsubscribe link by [adding an `::unsubscribeUrl::` placeholder](/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v4/campaigns/creating-a-campaign#setting-the-content-and-using-placeholders) to the HTML of your campaign.

When a subscriber visits the actual unsubscribe URL, a simple message will be displayed to confirming that they have  successfully unsubscribed.

To customize this confirmation message, publish the views.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Mailcoach\MailcoachServiceProvider" --tag="mailcoach-views"
```

Now we modify the following views in the `/resources/views/vendor/mailcoach/landingPages/` directory:

- `unsubscribed.blade.php`
- `couldNotFindSubscription.blade.php`

## Unsubscribing manually

You can also unsubscribe someone manually like this.

```php
$emailList->unsubscribe('john@example.com');
```

Alternatively, you can call unsubscribe on a subscriber

```php
Subscriber::findForEmail('john@example.com', $emailList)->unsubscribe();
```

## Unsubscribing using an email client

Emails sent have the ```List-Unsubscribe``` header included. This allows for users to unsubscribe from their email client as per [RFC2369](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2369.txt).

## Permanently deleting a subscriber

Behind the scenes, the subscriber won't be deleted. Instead, the status of the subscription will be updated to `unsubscribed`.

If you want to delete the subscription/subscriber entirely, you can call `delete` on it.

```php
Subscriber::findForEmail('john@example.com', $emailList)->delete();
```

The code above will also delete all related subscriptions.
