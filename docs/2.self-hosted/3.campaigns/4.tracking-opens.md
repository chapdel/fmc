title: Tracking opens
---

The package can track when and how many times a subscriber opens a campaign.

## Enabling open tracking

To use this feature, you must configure your email provider to track opens.

## How it works under the hood

When you send a campaign, the email service provider will add a web beacon to it..  A web beacon is an extra `img` tag in the HTML of your mail.  Its `src` attribute points to an unique endpoint on the domain of the email service provider.

Each time an email client tries to display the web beacon it will send a `get` request to email server. This way the email service provider will know the mail has been opened.

Via a web hook, the email service provider will let Mailcoach know that the mail has been opened.
