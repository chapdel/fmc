title: Bring your own editor
---

If you've installed Mailcoach in an existing Laravel app, you can add support for any editor you'd like.

## Creating an editor

An `Editor` is a simple PHP class that implements the `\Spatie\Mailcoach\Support\Editor\Editor` interface.

It requires that you implement a `render()` function that accepts a `\Spatie\Mailcoach\Models\Concerns\HasHtmlContent` object, this is a model that has 2 methods on it.

You can use the default `\Spatie\Mailcoach\Support\Editor\TextEditor` implementation as a reference

```php
public function render(HasHtmlContent $model): string
{
    return view('mailcoach::app.campaigns.draft.textEditor', [
        'html' => $model->getHtml(),
    ])->render();
}
```

This renders the `textEditor.blade.php` view of Mailcoach that makes heavy use of Blade Components.

This view will be rendered inside the forms of Campaigns and Templates, the only thing we require is that the `Editor` passes **valid html** through an input with the name `html`.

Mailcoach provides a secondary `structured_html` field in which you can pass anything your `Editor` needs to rebuild its view (our Unlayer editor uses this field to store the Unlayer specific JSON format).
