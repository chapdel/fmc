Mailcoach on traditional hosting requires:

- MySQL 8.1 or higher
- Imagick
- ext-exif
- Laravel Horizon
- Redis

If you're running Mailcoach on a load balancer and want to use Automations, make sure to enable sticky sessions as Laravel Livewire doesn't work well with load balancers.

Mailcoach on Vapor requires:

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Docker (installed locally to deploy to Vapor)
- Laravel 9 or higher
- Redis
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Imagick
- ext-exif
- Laravel Horizon
