title: How does pricing work?
---

Hosted Mailcoach starts with a {{ config('settings.trial_duration_days') }} day free trial. During this trial, you can send 100 emails.

<!-- Change to {{ number_format(config('settings.max_trial_sends'), 0) }} after launch -->

Once your trial has expired, you can pick a plan that fits your needs.

On top of the base price of each plan, hosted Mailcoach also charges a small fee per email sent.
