## What is Mailcoach?

Mailcoach is a hosted email marketing platform that integrates with services like [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) or [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to send out bulk mailings and drip campaigns affordably. It can also keep track of all transactional mails sent out by your app through the API.

It's the perfect email list service for bloggers, artisans and entrepreneurs.
