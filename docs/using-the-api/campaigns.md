## Get all campaigns

The `/mailcoach/api/campaigns` endpoint lists all your campaigns.

```shell script
$ MAILCOACH_TOKEN="your API token"
$ curl https://example.app/mailcoach/api/campaigns \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Searching is possible on this endpoint using `?filter[search]=searchterm` for searching.

Filtering is possible on the status of the campaigns using `?filter[status]=sent`, possible values are `sent`, `scheduled` and `draft`

Sorting is possible on this endpoint. For example `?sort=-name` to sort descending on `name`.
Allowed sorts:
- `name`
- `unique_open_count`
- `unique_click_count`
- `unsubscribe_rate`
- `sent_to_number_of_subscribers`
- `sent`

As a result, you get the details of all your campaigns:

## Add a campaign

To add a campaign, create a `POST` call to the `/mailcoach/api/campaigns/` endpoint.

```shell script
$ MAILCOACH_TOKEN="your API token"
$ curl -X POST https://example.app/mailcoach/api/campaigns \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"Campaign name", "email_list_id": 1, "html": "<html>...</html>", "track_opens": true, "track_clicks": false}'
```

Your request payload should also be valid JSON. The actual payload, when formatted, looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Campaign name",
  "email_list_id": 1,
  "html": "html",
  "track_opens": true,
  "track_clicks": false
}
```

The only required fields are the campaign's `name` and `list_id`.

Fields:
- `name` => required | string
- `email_list_id` => required | integer
- `segment_id` => integer
- `html` => string
- `mailable_class` => string
- `track_opens` => boolean
- `track_clicks` => boolean
- `schedule_at` => date_format:Y-m-d H:i:s

If the API call succeeded, you'll be given output like this.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Campaign name",
        "html": "<html>...</html>\n",
        ...
    }
}
```

## Update a campaign

To update a campaign, create a `PUT` call to the `/mailcoach/api/campaigns/<id>` endpoint. In the example below we're updating the campaign with ID 99.

```shell script
$ MAILCOACH_TOKEN="your API token"
$ curl -X PUT https://example.app/mailcoach/api/campaigns/99 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"Updated name", "html":"<html>...</html>"}'
```

The only required fields are the campaign's `name` and `list_id`. Other fields are the same when creating a campaign.

If the API call succeeded, you'll be given output like this.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": 99,
        "name": "Updated name",
        "html": "<html>...</html>\n",
        ...
    }
}
```

## Delete a campaign

To delete a campaign, create a `DELETE` call to the `/mailcoach/api/campaigns/<id>` endpoint. In the example below we're deleting the campaign with ID 99.

```shell script

    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"email":"john@doe.com"}'
```
