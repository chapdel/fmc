title: Creating an automation
---

When creating an automation, you can either create a new one from scratch or duplicate an existing one to copy most of its settings:

## Settings

Most of the settings for creating a new automation are pretty self-explanatory:

The name of an automation is only used within the Mailcoach UI. Subscribers will not see this anywhere.

The trigger determines how subscribers enter your automation, the most commonly used one is the "When a user subscribes" option. Some triggers might have some extra fields, like the "On a date" tirgger that lets you set up the date & time.

The List menu allows you to pick one of your lists, which you can further narrow down by picking one of its Segments right below it. You can read more about [tags and segments here](/docs/email-lists/segmentation-tags).

## Actions

This is where you'll define the flow of the automation. You can add actions by clicking on the "+" and choosing an action to add to your automation flow.

The screenshot shows an example of a welcome email, that waits 1 hour before sending the "Welcome" automation mail. More about setting up [automation mails here](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-mailcoach/v5/using-mailcoach#automation-mails).

## Run

This screen allows you to configure the interval at which subscribers will move through the actions. This setting allows you to limit the performance impact of large lists if, for example, you're waiting for several days between each step.

The Start/Pause button is pretty self-explanatory, it allows you start & pause the automation.
