Mailcoach supports sending mails through Sendinblue. This page contains instructions to [set up Sendinblue in the standalone Mailcoach app](/docs/self-hosted/v6/configuring-mail-providers/sendinblue#using-sendinblue-in-the-mailcoach-standalone-app) and [in a Laravel app with `laravel-mailcoach`](/docs/self-hosted/v6/configuring-mail-providers/sendinblue#handling-sendinblue-feedback-in-an-existing-laravel-app).

## Using Sendinblue in the Mailcoach standalone app

First off, make sure you have created an account with [Sendinblue](https://sendinblue.com).

### Configuring Sendinblue

At Sendinblue you must [configure a new webhook](https://app-smtp.sendinblue.com/webhook).

The webhook should be sent to `https://<your-domain>/sendinblue-feedback?secret=YOUR_SECRET`

You must turn on the `Hard Bounce` and `Complaint` events.

Optionally, you can turn on the `Known Open`, `Loaded by proxy` and `Cliked` events.

### Configuring Mailcoach

On the Mail configuration settings screen in Mailcoach, you'll have to fill in these settings.

- Mails per second: to not overwhelm Sendinblue with mail requests, set this to a sensible value. In many cases `10` will be sufficient
- API Key: you can get the right value on the [SMTP & API Screen](https://account.sendinblue.com/advanced/api)
- Signing secret: this should be set to the value you specified for the `secret` url parameter.

## Handling Postmark feedback in an existing Laravel app

You should only follow these instructions when you've installed Mailcoach in an existing app.

The `spatie/laravel-mailcoach-sendinblue-feedback` package can handle bounce feedback coming from Sendinblue. All email addresses that permanently bounce will be unsubscribed from all lists.

You can install the add-on package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-mailcoach-sendinblue-feedback:^1.0
```

### Adding the webhooks route

You must use this route macro in your route service provider. Do **NOT** apply the `web` group middleware to this route as that would cause an unnecessary session to be started for each webhook call.

You can replace `sendinblue-feedback` with any url you'd like.


```php
Route::sendinblueFeedback('sendinblue-feedback');
```

### Configuring webhooks

At Sendinblue you must [configure a new webhook](https://app-smtp.sendinblue.com/webhook).

The webhook should be sent to `https://<your-domain>/sendinblue-feedback?secret=YOUR_SECRET`

You must turn on the `Hard Bounce` and `Complaint` events.

Optionally, you can turn on the `Known Open`, `Loaded by proxy` and `Cliked` events.

In the `mailcoach` config file you must add this section.

```php
// in config/mailcoach.php

    'sendinblue_feedback' => [
        'signing_secret' => env('SENDINBLUE_SIGNING_SECRET'),
   ],
```

In your `.env` you must add a key `SENDINBLUE_SIGNING_SECRET` the value should be set to the value you specified in the `secret` url parameter on the Sendinblue webhook settings screen:

```
SENDINBLUE_SIGNING_SECRET=
```
