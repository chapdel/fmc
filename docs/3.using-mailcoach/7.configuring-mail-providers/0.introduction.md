We recommend using one of these providers to send out mail.

- [Amazon SES](/docs/self-hosted/v7/configuring-mail-providers/amazon-ses)
- [SendGrid](/docs/self-hosted/v7/configuring-mail-providers/sendgrid)
- [Mailgun](/docs/self-hosted/v7/configuring-mail-providers/mailgun)
- [Postmark](/docs/self-hosted/v7/configuring-mail-providers/postmark)

Mailcoach also supports sending via SMTP. When using SMTP, open and click tracking will not be available.
