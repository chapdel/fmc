First off, make sure you have created an account with [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com).

To get a 20% discount for the first three months on all subscriptions, you can use this coupon code: `POSTMARKLOVESMAILCOACH20`.

To get started, got to Configuration > Settings > Mailers, and create a Mailer for the "Postmark" Email service.

After that, you'll be greeted with a nice wizard that will help you set this up at Postmark. In order to start configuring this on your account, the wizard will ask for specifying a Postmark server API token.

### How to create a server Postmark API token

1. Log into your Postmark account.
2. Follow these instructions in the Postmark docs on [how to obtain your Postmark API keys](https://docs.gravityforms.com/get-postmark-api-keys/).

Copy the Server API token to the Server API token field in the wizard at Mailcoach, and continue the wizard.
