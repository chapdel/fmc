Using `/api/transactional-mails/send` endpoint you can send a transactional mail.

```shell script
$ MAILCOACH_TOKEN="your API token"
$ curl -X POST ::tenantUrl::/api/transactional-mails/send \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"mail_name":"name-of-the-mail", "subject": "Subject of your mail", ...}'
```

These are the parameters you should give to this call:

- `mail_name`: the name of the transactional mail as specified [on the mails screen](::tenantUrl::/transactional-mail-templates/).
- `subject`: the subject used for the transactional mail
- `from`: the from address that will be used
- `to`: the to address to use. You can specify multiple addresses comma-delimited.
- `cc`: the cc address to use.  You can specify multiple addresses comma-delimited.
- `bcc`: the bcc address to use.  You can specify multiple addresses comma-delimited.
- `store`: defaults to `true`, when set to false the transactional mail will not be added to the transactional mail log
- `mailer`: the name of the mailer to use to send the mail. If not set, we'll use the default of your account
- `replacements`: a key-value array that will be used to fill all replacers in your mail
- `fake`: defaults to `false`, when set to true the mail will not be sent but will be logged as if it was sent
