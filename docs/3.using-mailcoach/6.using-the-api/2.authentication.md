Authentication to the Mailcoach API is done by using a `Bearer token`, you can create a new token [in your account](/settings/account/tokens).

## User endpoint

You can use the user endpoint to get the details of the currently logged in user.

```shell script
$ MAILCOACH_TOKEN="your API token"
$ curl ::tenantUrl::/api/user \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCOACH_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

As a result, you get the details of the user that this token belongs to

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "john@doe.com",
    "created_at": "2020-08-06T12:08:25.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2020-08-06T12:08:25.000000Z"
  }
}
```
