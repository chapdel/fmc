When using PHP, the easiest way to get started the API would be to use [our SDK package](https://github.com/spatie/mailcoach-sdk-php).

Using this package you can currently manage email lists, subscribers and campaigns.

Here are a few examples:

```php
$mailcoach = new \Spatie\MailcoachSdk\Mailcoach('<api-key>', '<mailcoach-api-endpoint>')

// creating a campaign
$campaign = $mailcoach->createCampaign([
    'email_list_uuid' => 'use-a-real-email-list-uuid-here',
    'name' => 'My new campaign'
    'fields' => [
        'title' => 'The title on top of the newsletter',
        'content' => '# Welcome to my newsletter'
    ],
]);

// sending a test of the campaign to the given email address
$campaign->sendTest('john@example.com');

// sending a campaign
$campaign->send();
```

By default, Mailcoach' endpoints will are paginated with a limit of 1000. The package makes it easy to work with paginated resources. Just call `->next()` to get the next page.

```php
// listing all subscribers of a list
$subscribers = $mailcoach->emailList('use-a-real-email-list-uuid-here')->subscribers();

do {
    foreach($subscribers as $subscriber) {
        echo $subscriber->email;
    }
} while($subscribers = $subscribers->next())
```

You'll find more example in [the readme of the SDK at GitHub](https://github.com/spatie/mailcoach-sdk-php).
