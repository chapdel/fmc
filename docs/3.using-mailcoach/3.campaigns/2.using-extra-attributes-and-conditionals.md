title: Using extra attributes and conditionals
---

When creating a new campaign, you can use `{{ subscriber.<key> }}` to get include the value of an [extra properties  defined on a subscriber](/docs/self-hosted/v7/using-mailcoach/email-lists/adding-custom-attributes).

Here's an example to get the extra property called language.

## Using a default

you can tack on  `| default("a default value")` to display a default value in case your subscriber doesn't have a specific attribute.

```twig
{{ subscriber.extra_key | default("a default value") }}
```

## Using conditionals

You can use attributes to render content conditionally. 

In this example, the subscriber has an [extra attribute](add link) called `language`. If the language is set to "FR" the mail will include "Bonjour" otherwise it will contain "Hello".

```twig
{% if subscriber.language == "FR" %}
Bonjour
{% else %}
Hello
{% endif %}
```
