title: Split testing or A/B testing a campaign
---

When creating email campaigns, you might wonder which subject line would result in the most opens? Or you may be trying to figure out which copy of a link in your mail would result in the most clicks?

Instead of making those decisions beforehand and hoping for the best, you can use split testing. You might also know this as A/B testing.

## The process

Let's explain the split testing sending process. When your email campaign split testing, the sending process will have these steps:

1. **The test stage**: we'll start sending emails to a small percentage of your list. These people will get a random variant. When those emails are sent, we'll wait a couple of hours (you can decide how many hours) and start counting opens, clicks, and unsubscribes for those sent emails.
2. **Deciding the winner**: After the test stage, we will look at each variant's number of clicks, opens, and subscribes. We'll determine the variant with the best metrics and send that variant to the remainder of the people on your list.

When your mail is sent, in addition to the statistics of your entire campaign, you'll see the statistics of each variant.

## Using split testing

When creating a new campaign, you can enable split testing by clicking the "Add split test" link.

A new split view will be added to the campaign. You can add as many splits as you want.

When you add a split, you can choose to split on the subject line and the content.
