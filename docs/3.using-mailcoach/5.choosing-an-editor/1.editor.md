### Configuring Mailcoach

Set the `mailcoach.campaign.editor` and `mailcoach.automationMail.editor` config values to `\Spatie\MailcoachEditor\Editor::class`

### Configuring the Editor

You can publish the configuration file using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MailcoachEditor\MailcoachEditorServiceProvider" --tag="mailcoach-editor-config"
```

The Editor also supports image uploads, you can configure the `disk_name` in the `mailcoach-editor.php` config file.

The package does not automatically delete uploads. If you upload files and replace them, the original files will still be stored on disk.

To remove unwanted uploads, delete the relevant `Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaCollections\Models\Media` models via code.

```php
Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaCollections\Models\Media::find($mediaId)->delete();
```

This way the files will also be deleted from the filesystem.

## Switching to and from the Editor

This Editor stores content in a structured way. When switching from or to the Editor, content in existing templates and draft campaigns might get lost.
