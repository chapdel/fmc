## Configuration via the UI

When you've installed Mailcoach as a standalone app, you can choose this editor via the UI on the settings screen.

### Configuring Mailcoach

Set the `mailcoach.editor` config value to `\Spatie\MailcoachUnlayer\UnlayerEditor::class`

### Configuring image uploads

The Mailcoach Unlayer editor supports image uploads.

To configure the `disk_name` and maximum images size, add the following configuration to your `mailcoach.php` config file.

```php
'unlayer' => [
    'disk_name' => env('MAILCOACH_UPLOAD_DISK', 'public'),
    'max_width' => 1500,
    'max_height' => 1500,
],
```

The package does not automatically delete uploads. If you upload files and replace them, the original files will still be stored on disk.

To remove unwanted upload, delete the relevant `Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaCollections\Models\Media` models via code.

```php
Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaCollections\Models\Media::find($mediaId)->delete();
```

This way the files will also be deleted from the filesytem.

### Customizing Unlayer

Our package installs the free version of Unlayer. Should you want to customize the looks or need extra behaviour, take a look at [the pricing plans of Unlayer](https://unlayer.com/pricing).

## Switching to and from Unlayer

Unlayer editor stores content in a structured way. When switching from or to Unlayer, content in existing templates and draft campaigns will get lost.
