title: Using a website

Mailcoach can render a beautiful website for your email list that displays an intro text, a subscription form, and all your past campaigns you sent to that list.

You can enable it in the website settings of your list.

Here's what it [looks like](https://freek-dev.mailcoach.app/archive) for one of our users on Mailcoach Cloud. On your self-hosted Mailcoach instance it will look similar.

When users click an edition and scroll a bit down, they can see the content of an edition. Here's [the content of an old edition](https://freek-dev.mailcoach.app/archive/fce1301b-6ab3-45c9-8cc0-66faac815129) of that newsletter. We automatically display the sent date there, so people have an indication of when the content was written.

In the website settings, you can also pick a header image and text, and also choose the base color of your archive. As a nice detail, the form element's value is displayed in the value's color.

Here's how the above website looks using different colors.
