title: What is a list?
---

A list is a collection of subscribers that have opted into receiving your emails. You may have a list containing the followers of your blog.

There are different ways to add subscribers to your list:

- Add them manually through the [interface](/docs/email-lists/adding-subscribers#content-manually)
- Set up a [subscription form](/docs/email-lists/adding-subscribers#content-forms)
- Add subscribers using the [CSV import](/docs/email-lists/adding-subscribers#content-importing)
- Add subscribers [through the API](/docs/using-the-api/subscribers)

With Mailcoach self-hosted or Mailcoach Cloud, there is no limits on the amount of lists or subscribers.
