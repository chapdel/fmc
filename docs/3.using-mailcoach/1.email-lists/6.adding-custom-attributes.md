title: Adding custom attributes

You can add extra attributes to any subscriber. These [attributes can be displayed or used in a conditional](/docs/self-hosted/v7/using-mailcoach/campaigns/using-extra-attributes-and-conditionals) when creating a campaign (or other types of mails in Mailcoach).

To get started, head over to the name "Attributes" screen on a subscriber. Here's how you would add an extra attribute called `language` to subscriber.

You can define as many extra attributes as you want.
