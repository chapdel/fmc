title: Configuring webhooks
---

Mailcoach can send a request to your app whenever:

- a user subscribed
- a user unsubscribed
- a campaign was sent
- a tag was added
- a tag was removed

You could use these webhooks keep your local database in sync in near-real-time with Mailcoach.

To get started had to the webhooks screen in settings.

## Securing webhooks

On the details page of a webhook, you can enter a secret.

This secret will be used to calculate a signature that will be added in the `Signature` header to all requests from Mailcoach to your app.

In order to verify that the payload has not been tempered with when you receive the webhook, you can use the payload of the request and your secret to calculate the signature and compare it with the one in the `Signature` header of the request.

```php
// Payload is the post request body.
// Secret is set in your webhook settings.

$payloadJson = json_encode($payload); 

$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payloadJson, $secret);
```

## Choosing which events to send
Sometimes you don't want all types of events to be sent to your webhook. You can select which event types you want on the webhook detail page.
*Note:* This feature was added as a non-breaking change. If you want to use this feature make sure you update the Mailcoach config file and publish and run the `create_webhook_calls_table` migration.

```php
// in config/mailcoach.php
'webhooks' => [
    'selectable_event_types_enabled' => false
]
```

After that you will need to publish and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="mailcoach-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```
