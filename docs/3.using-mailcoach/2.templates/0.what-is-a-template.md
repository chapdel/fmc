title: What is a template?
---

A template is a reusable layout that can be used as a starting point for your campaigns, automation emails or transactional mails.

We provide a few basic templates to get you started.

If you'd like something a bit more custom, you can also [create your own template](/docs/templates/creating-a-template).
