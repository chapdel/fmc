title: Creating a template
---

To create a template, head over to your templates screen and click the "Create template" button.
Depending on which editor you've configured as the template editor, you'll either see an HTML editor or a drag-and-drop (Unlayer) editor.

### Mjml
Since v7 of Mailcoach, we support Mjml. Mjml is a markup language that makes it easier to create responsive emails. You can read more about Mjml on [mjml.io](https://mjml.io/).
We suggest to use the CodeMirror editor when using Mjml, as it will provide syntax highlighting and autocompletion.

### Changing the editor

To change the editor, head over to the settings screen. More info can be found in the [Editor part of the docs]((https://mailcoach.app/docs/self-hosted/v6/using-mailcoach/choosing-an-editor/introduction)).


### Slots

You can add "slots" to your template by entering the slot name between triple brackets, for example: `[[[content]]]`.

Once you create an email with this template, you'll get a field with your configured content editor for each slot.

<!-- @todo: Screenshot -->

You can also create templates without any slots, these will copy the full HTML contents to the email when used.
